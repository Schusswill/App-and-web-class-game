					well, currently it is insignificant but soon it will be known as ground zero for the greatest rain <br>
					of terror ever to befell this small planet.

					<a href=2avirus.html> take all the systems of your host</a> <br>
					or <br>
					<a href=2bvirus.html> spread your tendrils to all of the computer owners email contacts?</a>
