					You are a small virus sitting on the hard drive of a small insignificant computer in this world. <br>
					Well, currently it is insignificant but soon it will be known as ground zero for the greatest rain <br>
					of terror ever to befell this small planet.
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin your rain of terror would you rather:<br>
					<a href=virus2a.html> take all the systems of your host</a> <br>
					or <br>
					<a href=virus2b.html> spread your tendrils to all of the computer owners email contacts?</a>
